<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >A nonempty subset, <span 
class="cmmi-10">H</span>, of a group <span 
class="cmmi-10">G </span>is called a <span 
class="cmmi-10">subgroup </span>of <span 
class="cmmi-10">G </span>if, relative to the
product in <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span>, <span 
class="cmmi-10">H </span>itself forms a group.

 id="x1-30002.1"></a>relative to the product in <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span></h4>
<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >We stress the phrase &#8221;relative to the product in <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span>&#8221;. Take, for instance, the subset
<span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>= <span 
class="cmsy-10">{</span>1<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span><span 
class="cmsy-10">-</span>1<span 
class="cmsy-10">} </span>in <span 
class="cmmi-10">Z</span>, the set of integers. Under the multiplication of integers, <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>is a
group. But <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>is not a subgroup of <span 
class="cmmi-10">Z </span>viewed as a group with respect to
+.

Herstein</h4>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >In order for us to find out more about the makeup of a given group <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span>, it may be too
much of a task to tackle all of <span 
class="cmmi-10">G </span>head-on. It might be desiderable to focus our
attention on appropriate pieces of <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span>, which are smaller, over which we have some
control, and are such that the information gathered about them can be used ot get
relevant information and insight about <span 
class="cmmi-10">G </span>itself. The question then becomes: What
should serve as suitable pieces for this kind of dissection of <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span>? Clearly, whatever we
choose as such pieces, we want them to reflect the fact that <span 
class="cmmi-10">G </span>is a group, not merely
any old set.
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   A group is distinguished from an ordinary set by the fact that it is endowed with
a well-behaved operation. It is thus natural to demand that such pieces
above behaved reasonably with respect to the operation of <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span>. Once this is
granted, we are led almost immediately to the concept of a subgroup of a
group.
