A sequence $ \{p_n\} $ in a metric space $ X $ is said to \\
converge if there is a point $p \in X$ with the following property: 

For every $\varepsilon > 0$ 
there is an integer $ N $ 
such that $n \geq N$ 
implies that $d(p_n, p)< \varepsilon$. 
(Here $d$ denotes the distance in $X$)
In this case we also 
say that 
$ \{ p_n \} $ 
converges to $ p $, 
or that $ p $ is the limit of $\{p_n\}$, and we write $ p_n \to p $,
