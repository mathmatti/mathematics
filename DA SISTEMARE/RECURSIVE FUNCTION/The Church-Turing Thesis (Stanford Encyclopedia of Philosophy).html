<h2><a name="Thesis">The Thesis and its History</a></h2>

<p>

The Church-Turing thesis concerns the notion of an <em>effective</em>
or <em>mechanical</em> method in logic and mathematics.
‘Effective’ and its synonym ‘mechanical’ are
terms of art in these disciplines: they do not carry their everyday
meaning. A method, or procedure, M, for achieving some desired result
is called ‘effective’ or ‘mechanical’ just in
case </p>

<ol>
<li>M is set out in terms of a finite number of exact instructions
(each instruction being expressed by means of a finite number of
symbols);</li>

<li>M will, if carried out without error, produce the desired result in
a finite number of steps;</li>

<li>M can (in practice or in principle) be carried out by a human being
unaided by any machinery save paper and pencil;</li>

<li>M demands no insight or ingenuity on the part of the human being
carrying it out.</li>
</ol>

<p>

A well-known example of an effective method is the truth table test
for tautologousness. In practice, of course, this test is unworkable
for formulae containing a large number of propositional variables, but
in principle one could apply it successfully to any formula of the
propositional calculus, given sufficient time, tenacity, paper, and
pencils.</p>

<p>

Statements that there is an effective method for achieving
such-and-such a result are commonly expressed by saying that there is
an effective method for obtaining the values of such-and-such a
mathematical function. For example, that there is an effective method
for determining whether or not any given formula of the propositional
calculus is a tautology -- e.g. the truth table method -- is expressed
in function-speak by saying that there is an effective method for
obtaining the values of a function, call it T, whose domain is the set
of formulae of the propositional calculus and whose value for any given
formula x, written T(x), is 1 or 0 according to whether x is, or is
not, a tautology.</p>

<p>

The notion of an effective method is an informal one, and attempts
to characterise effectiveness, such as the above, lack rigour, for the
key requirement that the method demand no insight or ingenuity is left
unexplicated. One of Turing's achievements in his paper of 1936 was to
present a formally exact predicate with which the informal predicate
‘can be calculated by means of an effective method’ may be
replaced. Church did the same (1936a). The replacement predicates that
Turing and Church proposed were, on the face of it, very different from
one another, but they turned out to be equivalent, in the sense that
each picks out the same set of mathematical functions. The
Church-Turing thesis is the assertion that this set contains every
function whose values can be obtained by a method satisfying the above
conditions for effectiveness. (Clearly, if there were functions of
which the informal predicate, but not the formal predicate, were true,
then the latter would be less general than the former and so could not
reasonably be employed to replace it.) When the thesis is expressed in
terms of the formal concept proposed by Turing, it is appropriate to
refer to the thesis also as ‘Turing's thesis’; and
<em>mutatis mutandis</em> in the case of Church.</p>

<p>

The formal concept proposed by Turing is that of <em>computability
by Turing machine</em>. He argued for the claim (Turing's thesis) that
whenever there is an effective method for obtaining the values of a
mathematical function, the function can be computed by a Turing
machine. The converse claim is easily established, for a Turing machine
program is itself a specification of an effective method: without
exercising any ingenuity or insight, a human being can work through the
instructions in the program and carry out the required operations. If
Turing's thesis is correct, then talk about the existence and
non-existence of effective methods can be replaced throughout
mathematics and logic by talk about the existence or non-existence of
Turing machine programs.</p>

<p>

Turing stated his thesis in numerous places, with varying degrees of
rigour. The following formulation is one of the most accessible.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Turing's thesis</strong>:
<br>
 LCMs [logical computing machines: Turing's expression for Turing
machines] can do anything that could be described as "rule of thumb" or
"purely mechanical". (Turing 1948:7.)</blockquote>

<p>

He adds: </p>

<blockquote>This is sufficiently well established that it is now agreed
amongst logicians that "calculable by means of an LCM" is the correct
accurate rendering of such phrases. (1948: 7.)</blockquote>

<p>

Turing introduced this thesis in the course of arguing that the
Entscheidungsproblem, or decision problem, for the predicate calculus -
posed by Hilbert (Hilbert and Ackermann 1928) -- is unsolvable. Here is
Church's account of the Entscheidungsproblem: </p>

<blockquote>By the Entscheidungsproblem of a system of symbolic logic
is here understood the problem to find an effective method by which,
given any expression Q in the notation of the system, it can be
determined whether or not Q is provable in the system. (Church 1936b:
41.)</blockquote>

<p>

The truth table test is such a method for the propositional calculus.
Turing showed that, given his thesis, there can be no such method for
the predicate calculus. He proved formally that there is no Turing
machine which can determine, in a finite number of steps, whether or
not any given formula of the predicate calculus is a theorem of the
calculus. So, given his thesis that if an effective method exists then
it can be carried out by one of his machines, it follows that there is
no such method to be found. </p>

<p>

Church had arrived at the same negative result a few months earlier,
employing the concept of lambda-definability in place of computability
by Turing machine. (A function of positive integers is said to be
lambda-definable if the values of the function can be calculated by a
process of repeated substitution.) Church and Turing discovered the
result quite independently of one another. Turing's method of obtaining
it is rather more satisfying than Church's, as Church himself
acknowledged in a review of Turing's work:</p>

<blockquote>computability by a Turing machine ... has the advantage of
making the identification with effectiveness in the ordinary (not
explicitly defined) sense evident immediately. (1937a:
43.)</blockquote>

<p>

(Another aspect in which their approaches differ is that Turing's
concerns were rather more general than Church's, in that the latter
considered only functions of positive integers (see below), whereas
Turing described his work as encompassing "computable functions of an
integral variable or a real or computable variable, computable
predicates, and so forth" (1936: 230). He intended to pursue the theory
of computable functions of a real variable in a subsequent paper, but
in fact did not do so.) </p>

<p>

Church used the (informal) expression ‘effectively
calculable’ to indicate that there is an effective method for
calculating the values of the function. He proposed that we</p>

<blockquote>define the notion ... of an effectively calculable function
of positive integers by identifying it with the notion of a recursive
function of positive integers (or of a lambda-definable function of
positive integers). (1936a: 356.)</blockquote>

<p>

The concept of a lambda-definable function is due to Church and Kleene
(Church 1932, 1936a, 1941, Kleene 1935) and the concept of a recursive
function to Gödel and Herbrand (Gödel 1934, Herbrand 1932).
The class of lambda-definable functions and the class of recursive
functions are identical. This was established in the case of functions
of positive integers by Church and Kleene (Church 1936a, Kleene 1936).
After learning of Church's proposal, Turing quickly established that
the apparatus of lambda-definability and his own apparatus of
computability are equivalent (1936: 263ff). Thus, in Church's proposal,
the words ‘recursive function of positive integers’ can be
replaced by the words ‘function of positive integers computable
by Turing machine’. </p>

<p>

Post referred to Church's identification of effective calculability
with recursiveness as a "working hypothesis", and quite properly
criticised Church for masking this hypothesis as a definition.</p>

<blockquote>[T]o mask this identification under a definition ... blinds
us to the need of its continual verification. (Post 1936:
105.)</blockquote>

<p>

This, then, is the "working hypothesis" that, in effect, Church
proposed: </p>

<blockquote><strong>Church's thesis</strong>:
<br>
 A function of positive integers is effectively calculable only if
recursive.</blockquote>

<p>

The reverse implication, that every recursive function of positive
integers is effectively calculable, is commonly referred to as <em>the
converse of Church's thesis</em> (although Church himself did not so
distinguish, bundling both theses together in his
‘definition’). If attention is restricted to functions of
positive integers then Church's thesis and Turing's thesis are
equivalent, in view of the previously mentioned results by Church,
Kleene and Turing. </p>

<p>

The term ‘Church-Turing thesis’ seems to have been first
introduced by Kleene, with a small flourish of bias in favour of
Church:</p>

<blockquote>So Turing's and Church's theses are equivalent. We shall
usually refer to them both as <em>Church's thesis</em>, or in
connection with that one of its ... versions which deals with
‘Turing machines’ as <em>the Church-Turing thesis</em>.
(Kleene 1967: 232.)</blockquote>

<p>

Much evidence has been amassed for the ‘working
hypothesis’ proposed by Church and Turing in 1936. One of the
fullest surveys is to be found in chapters 12 and 13 of Kleene (1952).
In summary: (1) Every effectively calculable function that has been
investigated in this respect has turned out to be computable by Turing
machine. (2) All known methods or operations for obtaining new
effectively calculable functions from given effectively calculable
functions are paralleled by methods for constructing new Turing
machines from given Turing machines. (3) All attempts to give an exact
analysis of the intuitive notion of an effectively calculable function
have turned out to be equivalent in the sense that each analysis
offered has been proved to pick out the same class of functions, namely
those that are computable by Turing machine. Because of the diversity
of the various analyses the latter is generally considered strong
evidence. For example, apart from the analyses already mentioned in
terms of lambda-definability and recursiveness, there are analyses in
terms of register machines (Shepherdson and Sturgis 1963), Post's
canonical and normal systems (Post 1943, 1946), combinatory
definability (Schönfinkel 1924, Curry 1929, 1930, 1932), Markov
algorithms (Markov 1960), and Gödel's notion of reckonability
(Gödel 1936, Kleene 1952).</p>

<p>

While there have from time to time been attempts to call the
Church-Turing thesis into question (for example by Kalmar (1959);
Mendelson (1963) replies), the summary of the situation that Turing
gave in 1948 is no less true today: "it is now agreed amongst logicians
that ‘calculable by means of an LCM’ is the correct
accurate rendering" (of the informal notion in question).</p>

<h2><a name="Bloopers">Misunderstandings of the Thesis</a></h2>

<p>

A myth seems to have arisen concerning Turing's paper of 1936,
namely that he there gave a treatment of the limits of mechanism and
established a fundamental result to the effect that the universal
Turing machine can simulate the behaviour of any machine. The myth has
passed into the philosophy of mind, generally to pernicious effect. For
example, the <em>Oxford Companion to the Mind</em> states: "Turing
showed that his very simple machine ... can specify the steps required
for the solution of any problem that can be solved by instructions,
explicitly stated rules, or procedures" (Gregory 1987: 784). Dennett
maintains that "Turing had proven - and this is probably his greatest
contribution - that his Universal Turing machine can compute any
function that any computer, with any architecture, can compute" (1991:
215); also that every "task for which there is a clear recipe composed
of simple steps can be performed by a very simple computer, a universal
Turing machine, the universal recipe-follower" (1978:. xviii). Paul and
Patricia Churchland assert that Turing's "results entail something
remarkable, namely that a standard digital computer, given only the
right program, a large enough memory and sufficient time, can compute
any rule-governed input-output function. That is, it can display any
systematic pattern of responses to the environment whatsoever" (1990:
26). These various quotations are typical of current writing on the
foundations of the computational theory of mind. It seems on the
surface unlikely that these authors mean to restrict the general
notions of ‘explicitly stated rule’, ‘instruction’, ‘clear recipe
composed of simple steps', ‘computer with any architecture’,
‘rule-governed function’ and ‘systematic pattern’ so as to apply only
to things that can be obeyed, simulated, calculated, or produced by a
machine that implements ‘effective’ methods in Turing's original sense.
But unless these notions are restricted in this way from the start, we
should reject such claims.</p>

<p>

Turing did not show that his machines can solve any problem that can
be solved "by instructions, explicitly stated rules, or procedures",
nor did he prove that the universal Turing machine "can compute any
function that any computer, with any architecture, can compute". He
proved that his universal machine can compute any function that any
Turing machine can compute; and he put forward, and advanced
philosophical arguments in support of, the thesis here called Turing's
thesis. But a thesis concerning the extent of effective methods --
which is to say, concerning the extent of procedures of a certain sort
that a human being unaided by machinery is capable of carrying out --
carries no implication concerning the extent of the procedures that
machines are capable of carrying out, even machines acting in
accordance with ‘explicitly stated rules’. For among a
machine's repertoire of atomic operations there may be those that no
human being unaided by machinery can perform.</p>

<p>

The further proposition, very different from Turing's own thesis,
that a Turing machine can compute whatever can be computed by any
machine working on finite data in accordance with a finite program of
instructions, is sometimes also referred to as (a version of) the
Church-Turing thesis or Church's thesis. For example, Smolensky
says:</p>

<blockquote>connectionist models ... may possibly even challenge the
strong construal of Church's Thesis as the claim that the class of
well-defined computations is exhausted by those of Turing machines.
(Smolensky 1988: 3.)</blockquote>

<p>

This loosening of established terminology is unfortunate, for
neither Church nor Turing endorsed, or even formulated, this further
proposition. There are numerous examples of this extended usage in the
literature. The following are typical.</p>

<blockquote>That there exists a most general formulation of machine and
that it leads to a unique set of input-output functions has come to be
called <em>Church's thesis</em>. (Newell 1980: 150.) 

<p>

[T]he work of Church and Turing fundamentally connects computers and
Turing machines. The limits of Turing machines, according to the
Church-Turing thesis, also describe the theoretical limits of all
computers. (McArthur 1991: 401.)</p>

<p>

[I]t is difficult to see how any language that could actually be run
on a physical computer could do more than Fortran can do. The idea that
there is no such language is called Church's thesis. (Geroch and Hartle
1986: 539.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Also (more distant still from anything that Church or Turing
actually wrote):</p>

<blockquote>I can now state the physical version of the Church-Turing
principle: "Every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly
simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite
means." This formulation is both better defined and more physical than
Turing's own way of expressing it. (Deutsch 1985: 99.)</blockquote>

<p>

This formulation may be ‘more physical’ than Turing's
own, but it is scarcely ‘better defined’. The notion of an
effective method played an important role in early debates about the
foundations of mathematics, and it was sufficiently clear to allow
Turing, Church, and others to recognize that different formal accounts
gave alternative modellings of the notion. Their notion was certainly
not that of a ‘finitely realizable physical system’.</p>

<p>

Gandy (1980) is one of the few writers to distinguish explicitly
between Turing's thesis and the stronger proposition that whatever can
be calculated by a machine can be calculated by a Turing machine.
Borrowing Gandy's terminology, I will call the stronger proposition
‘Thesis M’. I will use expressions such as ‘the
Church-Turing thesis properly so-called’ for the proposition that
Church and Turing themselves endorsed.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Thesis M</strong>:
<br>
 Whatever can be calculated by a machine (working on finite data in
accordance with a finite program of instructions) is
Turing-machine-computable.</blockquote>

<p>

Thesis M itself admits of two interpretations, according to whether
the phrase "can be generated by a machine" is taken in the narrow,
this-worldly, sense of "can be generated by a machine that conforms to
the physical laws (if not to the resource constraints) of the actual
world", or in a wide sense that abstracts from the issue of whether or
not the notional machine in question could exist in the actual world.
Under the latter interpretation, thesis M is false. It is
straightforward to describe notional machines, or
‘hypercomputers’ ( Copeland and Proudfoot (1999a)) that
generate functions not Turing-machine-computable (see e.g. Abramson
(1971), Copeland (2000), Copeland and Proudfoot (2000), Stewart
(1991)). It is an open empirical question whether or not the narrow
this-worldly version of thesis M is true. Speculation that there may be
physical processes -- and so, potentially, machine-operations -- whose
behaviour conforms to functions not computable by Turing machine
stretches back over at least five decades; see, for example, da Costa
and Doria (1991), (1994), Doyle (1982), Geroch and Hartle (1986),
Hogarth (1994), Kreisel (1967), (1974), (1982), Pour-El and Richards
(1979), (1981), Scarpellini (1963), Siegelmann and Sontag (1994), and
Stannett (1990). (Copeland and Sylvan (1999) is a survey; see also
Copeland and Proudfoot (1999b).)</p>

<p>

The literature on the computational theory of the mind contains
numerous endorsements of propositions equivalent or similar to thesis M
that are supported by nothing more than a nod toward Turing or Church
(as is illustrated by a number of the quotations given earlier).
Perhaps some writers are simply misled by the terminological practice
whereby a thesis concerning which there is little real doubt, the
Church-Turing thesis properly so called, and a different thesis of
unknown truth-value, are referred to indiscriminately as Church's
thesis or the Church-Turing thesis -- albeit with accompanying hedges
like ‘strong form’ and ‘physical version’.
Other writers may maintain thesis M (or some equivalent or near
equivalent) on the spurious grounds that the various, and prima facie
very different, attempts -- by Turing, Church, Post, Markov, and others
-- to characterise in precise terms the informal notion of an effective
procedure have turned out to be equivalent to one another. This is
evidence concerning the extent of effective procedures, and not
evidence concerning the extent of what can be calculated by
machine.</p>

<p>

The error of confusing the Church-Turing thesis properly so-called
with thesis M has led to some remarkable claims in the foundations of
psychology. For example, one frequently encounters the view that
psychology must be capable of being expressed ultimately in terms of
the Turing machine (e.g. Fodor 1981: 130; Boden 1988: 259). To one who
makes the error, conceptual space will seem to contain no room for
mechanical models of the mind that are not equivalent to Turing
machines.Yet it is certainly possible that psychology will find the
need to employ models of human cognition that transcend Turing
machines.</p>

<p>

Note that in some cases, an author's apparent endorsement of M is
merely apparent. In this connection, it is important to remember that
in the technical literature the word ‘computable’ is often
tied by definition to effective calculability. Thus a function is said
to be computable if and only if there is an effective procedure for
determining its values. Accordingly, a common formulation of the
Church-Turing thesis in the technical literature and in textbooks
is:</p>

<blockquote>All computable functions are computable by Turing
machine.</blockquote>

<p>

Corollaries such as the following are sometimes offered:</p>

<blockquote>certain functions are uncomputable in an absolute sense:
uncomputable even by [Turing machine], and, therefore, uncomputable by
any past, present, or future real machine. (Boolos and Jeffrey 1980:
55.)</blockquote>

<p>

Given the definition of ‘computable’ as ‘effectively
calculable’, the Church-Turing thesis does entail that if a
function f is not computable by Turing machine then it is not
computable by any machine. However, to a casual reader of the technical
literature, such statements may appear to say more than they in fact
do. (Of course, the decision to tie the term ‘computable’
and its cognates to the concept of effectiveness does not settle the
truth-value of thesis M. Those who abide by this terminological
decision are simply prevented from describing a machine that falsifies
thesis M as computing the function that it generates.) </p>

<p>

The word ‘mechanical’, too, in technical usage, is tied
to effectiveness and, as already remarked, ‘mechanical’ and
‘effective’ are used interchangeably. (Gandy (1988)
outlines the history of this usage of the word
‘mechanical’.) Thus statements like the following are to be
found in the technical literature:</p>

<blockquote>Turing proposed that a certain class of abstract machines
could perform any ‘mechanical’ computing procedure.
(Mendelson 1964: 229.)</blockquote>

<p>

Understood correctly, this remark attributes to Turing not thesis M but
the Church-Turing thesis. This usage of ‘mechanical’ tends
to obscure the possibility that there may be machines, or biological
organs, that calculate (or compute, in a broad sense) functions that
are not Turing-machine-computable. For the question ‘Can a
machine execute a procedure that is not mechanical?’ may appear
self-answering, yet this is precisely what is asked if thesis M is
questioned. </p>

<p>

Thesis M is not the only problematic thesis that is linked to the
Church-Turing thesis. An error which, unfortunately, is common in
modern writing on computability and the brain is to hold that Turing's
results somehow entail that the brain, and indeed any biological or
physical system whatever, can be simulated by a Turing machine. For
example, the entry on Turing in the recent <em>A Companion to the
Philosophy of Mind</em> contains the following claims: "we can depend
on there being a Turing machine that captures the functional relations
of the brain", for so long as "these relations between input and output
are functionally well-behaved enough to be describable by ...
mathematical relationships ... we know that some specific version of a
Turing machine will be able to mimic them" (Guttenplan 1994: 595).
Searle writes in a similar fashion:</p>

<blockquote>Can the operations of the brain be simulated on a digital
computer? ... The answer seems to me ... demonstrably ‘Yes’
... That is, naturally interpreted, the question means: Is there some
description of the brain such that under that description you could do
a computational simulation of the operations of the brain. But given
Church's thesis that anything that can be given a precise enough
characterization as a set of steps can be simulated on a digital
computer, it follows trivially that the question has an affirmative
answer. (Searle 1992: 200.)</blockquote>

<p>

So too Johnson-Laird, and the Churchlands: </p>

<blockquote>If you assume that [consciousness] is scientifically
explicable ... [and] [g]ranted that the [Church-Turing] thesis is
correct, then ... [i]f you believe [functionalism] to be false ... then
... you [should] hold that consciousness could be modelled in a
computer program in the same way that, say, the weather can be modelled
... [and if] you accept functionalism ... you should believe that
consciousness is a computational process. (Johnson-Laird 1987:
252.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Church's Thesis says that whatever is computable is Turing
computable. Assuming, with some safety, that what the mind-brain does
is computable, then it can in principle be simulated by a computer.
(Churchland and Churchland 1983: 6.)</blockquote>

<p>

As previously mentioned, Churchland and Churchland seem to believe,
erroneously, that Turing's "results entail ... that a standard digital
computer, given only the right program, a large enough memory and
sufficient time, can ... display any systematic pattern of responses to
the environment whatsoever" (1990: 26). (They do not explicitly
restrict talk of ‘systematic patterns’ to ones that are
effectively calculable.) This no doubt explains why they think they can
assume "with some safety" that what the mind-brain does is computable,
for on their understanding of matters this is to assume only that the
mind-brain exhibits a systematic pattern of responses, or is
characterised by a ‘rule-governed’ (1990: 26) input-output
function. </p>

<p>

The Church-Turing thesis does not entail that the brain (or the
mind, or consciousness) can be modelled by a Turing machine program,
not even in conjunction with the belief that the brain (or mind, etc.)
is scientifically explicable, or exhibits a systematic pattern of
responses to the environment, or is ‘rule-governed’ (etc.). Each of the
authors quoted seems to be assuming the truth of a close cousin of
thesis M, which I will call</p>

<blockquote>Thesis S: Any process that can be given a mathematical
description (or that is scientifically describable or scientifically
explicable) can be simulated by a Turing machine.</blockquote>

<p>

As with thesis M, neither the Church-Turing thesis properly
so-called nor any result proved by Turing or Church entails thesis S.
This is so even when the thesis is taken narrowly, as concerning
processes that conform to the physics of the real world. (Thesis S
taken in the wide sense is known to be false; see the references given
earlier re the wide version of thesis M.) Any device or organ whose
internal processes can be described completely by means of effectively
calculable functions can be simulated exactly by a Turing machine
program (provided that the input into the device or organ is itself
Turing-machine-computable, which is to say, is either finite or
expressible as a computable number, in Turing's sense (which is
explained below)); but any device or organ whose mathematical
description involves functions that are not effectively calculable
cannot be so simulated. As Turing showed, there are uncountably many
such functions. (Examples from logic are Turing's famous halting
function (described in the entry on Turing machines) and the function D
whose domain is the set of well-formed formulae of the predicate
calculus and whose values, D(x), are 1 or 0 according to whether x is,
or is not, derivable from the Bernays-Hilbert-Ackermann axioms for
predicate logic.) It is an open question whether a completed
neuroscience will employ functions that are not effectively
calculable.</p>

<h2><a name="Turing">Some Key Remarks by Turing</a></h2>

<p>

Turing introduces his machines with the intention of providing an
idealised description of a certain human activity, the tedious one of
<em>numerical computation</em>, which until the advent of automatic
computing machines was the occupation of many thousands of people in
business, government, and research establishments. He prefaces his
first description of a Turing machine with the words: </p>

<blockquote>We may compare a man in the process of computing a ...
number to a machine. (Turing 1936: 231.)</blockquote>

<p>

The Turing machine is a model, idealised in certain respects, of a
human being calculating in accordance with an effective procedure.
Wittgenstein put this point in a striking way: </p>

<blockquote>Turing's "Machines". These machines are <em>humans</em> who
calculate. (Wittgenstein 1980, 1096.)</blockquote>

<p>

It is a point that Turing was to emphasise, in various forms, again and
again. For example: </p>

<blockquote>A man provided with paper, pencil, and rubber, and subject
to strict discipline, is in effect a universal machine. (Turing 1948:
9.)</blockquote>

<p>

The electronic stored-program digital computers for which the
universal Turing machine was a blueprint are, each of them,
computationally equivalent to a Turing machine, and so they too are, in
a sense, models of human beings engaged in computation. Turing chose to
emphasise this when explaining these electronic machines in a manner
suitable for an audience of uninitiates:</p>

<blockquote>The idea behind digital computers may be explained by
saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations
which could be done by a human computer. (Turing 1950a:
436).</blockquote>

<p>

He makes the point a little more precisely in the technical document
containing his preliminary design for the Automatic Computing Engine or
ACE. (The ACE was an electronic stored-program computer built at the
National Physical Laboratory, London. A pilot version first ran in 1950
and at the time was the fastest computer in the world. The commercial
model was called the DEUCE.) </p>

<blockquote>The class of problems capable of solution by the machine
[the ACE] can be defined fairly specifically. They are [a subset of]
those problems which can be solved by human clerical labour, working to
fixed rules, and without understanding. (Turing 1946:
38-9.)</blockquote>

<p>

(Turing went on to characterise the subset in terms of the amount of
paper and time available to the human clerk.) It was presumably because
he considered the point under discussion to be essential for
understanding the nature of the new electronic machines that he chose
to begin his <em>Programmers' Handbook for Manchester Electronic
Computer</em> with this explanation: </p>

<blockquote>Electronic computers are intended to carry out any definite
rule of thumb process which could have been done by a human operator
working in a disciplined but unintelligent manner. (Turing 1950b:
1.)</blockquote>

<p>

It was not some deficiency of imagination that led Turing to model
his computing machines on what could be achieved by a human computer.
The purpose for which the Turing machine was invented demanded it. The
Entscheidungsproblem is the problem of finding a <em>humanly
executable</em> procedure of a certain sort, and Turing's aim was
precisely to show that there is no such procedure in the case of
predicate logic. He proved that no Turing machine can compute the
values of the function D that I described earlier, and he argued that
his model of human computation is sufficiently general, in the sense
that there are no intuitively computable (i.e. effectively calculable)
functions that Turing machines are incapable of computing.</p>

<p>

The latter claim is, of course, Turing's thesis. Here are two
additional formulations of the thesis, from his paper of 1936.</p>

<blockquote>[T]he "computable numbers" [the numbers whose decimal
representations can be generated progressively by a Turing machine]
include all numbers which would naturally be regarded as computable.
(Turing 1936: 249.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is my contention that these operations [the primitive
operations of a Turing machine] include all those which are used in the
computation of a number. (Turing 1936: 232.)</blockquote>

<p>

(As Turing explains: "Although the subject of this paper is ostensibly
the computable numbers, it is almost equally easy to define and
investigate computable functions ... I have chosen the computable
numbers for explicit treatment as involving the least cumbrous
technique" (1936: 230).) </p>

<p>

To understand these assertions as Turing intended them it is
essential to keep in mind that when he uses the words ‘computer’,
‘computable’ and ‘computation’ he employs them not in their modern
sense as pertaining to machines but as pertaining to human calculators.
Many passages make this obvious.</p>

<blockquote>Computers always spend just as long in writing numbers down
and deciding what to do next as they do in actual multiplications, and
it is just the same with ACE ... [T]he ACE will do the work of about
10,000 computers ... Computers will still be employed on small
calculations ... (Turing 1947: 116, 120.)</blockquote>

<p>

Thus when Turing maintains that every number or function that "would
naturally be regarded as computable" can be calculated by a Turing
machine he is asserting not thesis M but a thesis concerning the extent
of the effectively calculable numbers and functions. Similarly, when
Church writes (in a review of Post (1936)): </p>

<blockquote>To define effectiveness as computability by an arbitrary
machine, subject to restrictions of finiteness, would seem to be an
adequate representation of the ordinary notion (Church 1937b:
43),</blockquote>

<p>

he is to be understood not as entertaining some form of thesis M but as
endorsing the identification of the effectively calculable functions
with those functions that can be calculated by an arbitrary machine
whose principles of operation are such as to mimic the actions of a
human computer. (There is much that is ‘arbitrary’ about
the machines described (independently, in the same year) by Turing and
Post, for example the one-dimensional arrangement of the squares of the
tape (or in Post's case, of the ‘boxes’), the absence of a
system of addresses for squares of the tape, the choice between a
two-way and a one-way infinite tape, and, in Post's case, the
restriction that a square admit of only two possible conditions, blank
or marked by a single vertical stroke.) </p>

<p>

It is equally important to note also that when Turing uses the word
‘machine’ he often means not machine-in-general but, as we
would now say, Turing machine. At one point he explicitly draws
attention to this idiosyncratic usage:</p>

<blockquote>The expression "machine process" of course means one which
could be carried out by the type of machine I was considering [in
Turing (1936)]. (Turing 1947: 107.)</blockquote>

<p>

Thus when, a few pages later, he asserts that "machine processes and
rule of thumb processes are synonymous" (1947: 112), he is to be
understood as advancing the Church-Turing thesis (and its converse),
not a version of thesis M. Unless his intended usage is borne in mind,
misunderstanding is certain to ensue. Especially liable to mislead are
statements like the following, which a casual reader might easily
mistake for a formulation of thesis M: </p>

<blockquote>The importance of the universal machine is clear. We do not
need to have an infinity of different machines doing different jobs. A
single one will suffice. The engineering problem of producing various
machines for various jobs is replaced by the office work of
"programming" the universal machine to do these jobs. (Turing 1948:
7.)</blockquote>

<p>

In context it is perfectly clear that these remarks concern machines
equivalent to Turing machines (the passage is embedded in a discussion
of LCMs).</p>

<p>

Whether or not Turing would, if queried, have assented to thesis M
is unknown. There is certainly no textual evidence in favour of the
common belief that he did so assent.</p>
