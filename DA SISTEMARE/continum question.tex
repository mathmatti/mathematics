Why the set of natural numbers $N^{>1}$ is enumerable but the set of the prime factorization of element of $N^{>1}$ is not enumerable?

I'm able to create a bijection between the set of all positive number greater than $1$ and the set of all natural numbers $N$: 

$F: N^{>1} \to N$

$n \to n-1$.

Now consider the prime factorizations on an integer greater than 1:

$(p_{1})^{a^{'}}(p_{2})^{a^{''}}...(p_{i})^{a^{x}}$ where $p_{i}$ are prime numbers and $a^{x}$ is the exponent of the prime factor (it is an integer too)r.
